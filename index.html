                    By now I trust you know my name, no need to review. I am new to this world of code. 
                    How did I get here you might be wondering? Well lets start with "Where"... San Diego,CA born and raised.
                    I grew up in a great neighborhood I absolutely love called Mira Mesa. The population seemed so small when I first moved there
                    as a child. I got to watch the neighborhood grow. I know the area front and back. Though I love San Diego and the beaches available
                    to me there, I always knew I wanted to leave. Even my mother used to say she knew I would leave one day. I moved to Mclean, Virginia 
                    back in 2016 with a boyfriend I had at the time. Since then I have grown and become the person I am today and I appreciate the journey
                    that has brought me to where I am today.

                    When I first moved here I had a job as a dispatcher for a locksmith company. 
                    I have held many jobs in my life starting with a bagger at a grocery store, a hostess at a restaurant, a server, cocktail waitress, 
                    locksmith and towing dispatcher, clothing store cashier, manager of a kiosk, non-profit canvasser, car sales, finance manager, 
                    dog walker, veterinary assistant and most recently a Marketing Account Executive. Through my life I have struggled with figuring 
                    out what to do with my life and what I wanted out of it. I have spent so much time trying to figure out what career would be most 
                    rewarding for me and all my desires come back to this one dream, to be a homemaker, a wife and a mother. I want to have the 
                    freedom to raise my children and keep my home filled with love and life. I am currently taking classes to learn code, I look forward
                    to completing the bootcamp and taking the opportunity of working from home with my new coding skills. Working from home will save
                    me time and energy I can use for my home and family instead of commuting and getting ready to leave in the mornings. 
                    Coding is my solution for a long term life change to accommodate my future family.
